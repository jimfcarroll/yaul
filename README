Yaul - Yet Another Utility Library

Well, why another utility library? Why not. Actually, this one should fill in 
a few gaps and not really replace what's out there.

Currently it contains a C++ based dependency injection framework. Please see
di/di.h for complete details.

Current Dependencies:
        boost::shared_ptr
        UnitTest++ - to build and run the tests
